## Open a new shell
This lesson supplements material covered in the [Introduction to the Unix Shell][install shell]. The shell software necessary for this lesson should therefore already be installed. 

1. Open a terminal.
2. In the terminal type `cd` then press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key.
   This step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory. 
   You can then navigate to the specific directory you want to work in or run the exercises from there.
